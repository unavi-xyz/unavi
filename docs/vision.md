# The UNAVI Vision

This document outlines the philosophical foundation, aesthetic principles, and
strategic direction of **UNAVI** and **The Wired**.

## What is UNAVI?

**UNAVI** is an open-source spatial browser — a gateway to three-dimensional
[hypermedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypermedia). It is built primarily
in [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/) using the [Bevy](https://bevy.org/)
engine, and serves as a reference implementation of **The Wired protocol**.

A **space** in UNAVI is a 3D hyperdocument. It can contain objects, portals, and
behaviors, all expressed through open formats and standard scripting APIs.
Spaces can be created, viewed, and hosted by anyone.

UNAVI is not a walled garden. It provides the foundation for an open,
interoperable ecosystem where identities, spaces, and objects operate under
shared standards rather than centralized control.

## What is The Wired?

**The Wired** is the spatial hypermedia layer of the Internet — an open
protocol for representing and linking shared 3D environments. It defines how
spaces, agents, and data interoperate across servers and clients.

The Wired is also a **philosophy**: information systems should reflect the
natural order of the human experience. Traditional digital interfaces flatten
information into screens and feeds, but humans evolved as
[spatial beings](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spatial_cognition). And as
[feng shui](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feng_shui) teaches, form and life are
inseparable.

The Wired restores spatial structure to digital information.

### Spatial Continuity

A defining aspect of The Wired is **seamless spatial continuity**. Spaces are
independent hyperdocuments, but they can be linked together through portals
without interruption of presence or state. Moving between spaces does not
require reloading, respawning, or resetting context; the transition is treated
as a continuation of the same session.

This design allows The Wired to function more like a network of physical
environments than a collection of separate applications. Users can navigate
across different servers while maintaining the same identity, objects, and
interaction model.

### Creation and Autopoiesis

At the heart of The Wired is a computation layer powered by
[WebAssembly](https://webassembly.org/). Its goal is
[autopoiesis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autopoiesis): systems that define
and maintain their own behavior through internal logic.

A space is a self-contained hyperdocument. Its layout, rules, and behaviors live
inside the space itself. Objects also embed their own logic and state, allowing
them to operate predictably in any environment.

Autopoiesis does not imply isolation. Objects can still **react to and
communicate with their surroundings** through explicit interfaces. A lamp keeps
its lighting logic but may respond to ambient brightness or signals from nearby
devices.

Autopoiesis gives The Wired a consistent, interoperable foundation.

## The Vision

UNAVI exists to give form to The Wired — to make spatial hypermedia usable,
open, and accessible. For decades, the web has been a network of text and
images. It is expressive, but fundamentally two-dimensional. People, however,
perceive and understand information through spatial relationships. Presence,
distance, orientation, and shared environments all influence how we think and
communicate.

UNAVI’s goal is to reintroduce these spatial qualities into digital life. This
is not about simulation or escapism; it is about creating interfaces that align
with how people actually understand the world.

When information lives in space, it becomes clearer, more navigable, and more
concrete. The Wired extends the Internet into a more natural, expressive form.

## Principles

The Wired, expressed through UNAVI, should be:

- **Open** — Based on transparent, community-driven standards.

- **Interoperable** — Objects, identities, and spaces move freely across hosts.

- **User-sovereign** — Users own their data and decide where it is stored.

- **Generative** — Systems should support internal growth and adaptation.

- **Human-centered** — Interfaces should reinforce presence, clarity, and
  meaningful interaction.

## Philosophical Roots

UNAVI draws from several traditions that examine technology, space, and
individual agency:

- **[Cybernetics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cybernetics)** — the study of
  feedback and self-regulating systems.

- **[Phenomenology](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phenomenology_(philosophy)>)**
  — particularly the work of
  [Martin Heidegger](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martin_Heidegger), whose
  notion of *Being-in-the-world* grounds existence in spatial relation. UNAVI
  takes this seriously: virtual space is not decoration but an existential
  medium.

- **[Christian humanism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christian_humanism)** —
  emphasizes the inherent dignity, worth, and potential of the individual.
  This aligns with UNAVI’s vision: reclaiming the individual against the
  flattening tendencies of the modern technosphere.

- **[Serial Experiments Lain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serial_Experiments_Lain)**
  — a prophetic artistic vision of The Wired as a shared psychological and
  informational space.

- **[Nick Land](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nick_Land)** and accelerationist
  philosophy — recognizes that technological systems possess autonomous
  tendencies of self-organization and escape. UNAVI acknowledges these dynamics
  and directs them toward constructive aims: The Wired is designed to support
  growth, adaptation, and complexity while maintaining human agency and
  recognizable form.

- **[Hypermedia Systems](https://hypermedia.systems/)** — A modern exploration
  of the Web as a hypermedia system, not an app platform. Advocates for a
  return to the original Web architecture. UNAVI extends this model into 3D.

## The Wired Manifesto

> The true form of the Internet already exists.\
> We need only to let it express itself.

UNAVI is the first step toward making that form visible and inhabitable.
