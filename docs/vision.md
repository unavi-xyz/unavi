# UNAVI Vision

This document outlines the philosophical foundation, aesthetic principles, and
strategic direction of **UNAVI** and **The Wired**.

______________________________________________________________________

## What is UNAVI?

**UNAVI** is an open-source platform for spatial communication and shared
creation.

Built primarily in [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/) using the
[Bevy](https://bevy.org/) engine, UNAVI serves as a reference
implementation of **The Wired protocol** — a framework for decentralized,
interoperable virtual worlds.

UNAVI is not a walled garden. It is a foundation for an open, composable
ecosystem — where every world, identity, and creation can connect through
shared standards.

## What is The Wired?

**The Wired** is an open protocol for the
[metaverse](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snow_Crash#Metaverse) — a vision of
how virtual worlds should work: decentralized, interoperable, and user-sovereign.

It defines how identities, spaces, and data communicate across different
implementations, without central control. But more than a specification, The
Wired is a **philosophy**: that information technology should reflect the
natural order of human experience.

Current digital systems abstract information away from the human — they flatten
it, strip it of place and relation, and deliver it through screens and feeds.
But humans cannot be separated from space and remain whole. Like
[feng shui](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feng_shui) describes, form and life
are inseparable; our sense of meaning, balance, and health arises
from the environments we inhabit.

The Wired reimagines information as **spatial** — something we move through,
inhabit, and shape with others. It is the restoration of form to the formless,
the rejoining of human and world through digital means.

### Creation and Autopoiesis

At the heart of The Wired is a shared computation layer powered by
[WebAssembly](https://webassembly.org/) (WASM).\
The goal is not simple scripting, but something more akin to
[autopoiesis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autopoiesis) — systems capable
of maintaining and regenerating their own structure.
Much of UNAVI is itself built within the WASM layer.

Space itself is seamless: transitions between areas, environments, or worlds
happen naturally, without artificial loading or separation. Portals, connections,
and interfaces preserve continuity, creating the sense of a single, persistent
reality.

Worlds connect to worlds, forming continuous space.
Agents traverse this space, carrying with them whatever objects they please.
Object behavior is managed at the object level, independent of any world.

Through this model, The Wired forms an ecology of computation — where entities,
environments, and users co-create experiences in a network of dynamic feedback.
Every addition, modification, or interaction propagates through the system,
contributing to its emergent behaviors.

## The Vision

UNAVI exists to **manifest The Wired** — to give visible, inhabitable form to
the hidden network that already connects us.

For decades, the web has been a network of text and images: flat, abstract, and
detached from our natural sense of being in space. Yet humans evolved as
[spatial beings](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spatial_cognition) — our
cognition, emotion, and social instincts are grounded in presence,
proximity, and embodiment.

UNAVI’s vision is to restore this dimension to digital life.\
To create the conditions for **real presence** in virtual space.\
To let interaction, creation, and connection unfold in the medium most natural
to us.

This is not about simulation or escapism — it is about *integration*.\
The Wired is the continuation of the internet into a more expressive, human
form — one that acknowledges that **information itself must live in space**.

We aim to open the floodgates of this new medium — to invite exploration,
discovery, and the emergence of new forms of culture, art, and communication
that can only exist when these are the axioms.

## Principles

The metaverse, as expressed through The Wired, should be:

- **Open** — Built on transparent, community-owned standards that anyone can
  extend or implement.
- **Interoperable** — Worlds, identities, and assets move freely across servers
  and clients.
- **User-sovereign** — Users own their identities and data, and may host or
  delegate storage as they choose.
- **Generative** — Environments are alive, adaptive, and capable of internal
  growth.
- **Human-centered** — Designed to enhance presence, expression, and
  understanding between man and the outside world.

## Philosophical Roots

UNAVI’s conceptual foundations draw from a lineage of thinkers and movements
concerned with **technology, space, and the fate of the individual**.

- **[Cybernetics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cybernetics)** — the study of
  self-regulating systems and feedback loops.

- **[Phenomenology](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phenomenology_(philosophy)>)** —
  particularly the work of [Martin Heidegger](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martin_Heidegger),
  whose notion of *Being-in-the-world* grounds existence in spatial relation.\
  UNAVI takes this seriously: virtual space is not decoration but an
  existential medium.

- **[Christian humanism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christian_humanism)** —\
  emphasizes the inherent dignity, worth, and potential of the individual as
  a bearer of the divine image.\
  This aligns with UNAVI’s vision: reclaiming the individual against the\
  flattening tendencies of the modern technosphere.

- **[Serial Experiments Lain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serial_Experiments_Lain)** —
  a prophetic artistic vision of The Wired as a psychic network and mirror of
  consciousness.\
  UNAVI treats Lain not as fiction but as myth: an intuition of what the
  internet could become (and has become) when interior life and technology converge.

- **[Nick Land](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nick_Land)** and accelerationist
  philosophy — recognizing that technological systems possess autonomous tendencies
  of self-organization and escape.\
  UNAVI accepts this as fact but redirects it toward the renewal of human
  form within the storm, rather than accepting its dissolution.

## The Wired Manifesto

> The true form of the Internet already exists.\
> We need only to let it express itself.

UNAVI is the first gesture toward that expression.

The Wired is not an escape from reality.\
It is reality, revealed in its authentic form.
