## ‚óªÔ∏è About

UNAVI is an open source VR social platform, built on [The Wired](https://github.com/unavi-xyz/wired-protocol).
Anyone can run their own servers, modify their client, and extend the underlying protocol to add new features.

UNAVI is almost entirely written in Rust ü¶Ä.
The app is built using [Bevy](https://bevyengine.org/) and makes heavy use of [WebAssembly](https://webassembly.org/) for user scripting.
Multiplayer is handled by self-hostable servers acting as relays for communication between players.
UNAVI provides both a web client and native build.

This project is still early, any feedback or contributions are really appreciated!

## ‚ùÑÔ∏è Development (with Nix)

### Build

Build all crates in release mode:

```bash
nix build
```

### Develop

Enter a development shell:

```bash
nix develop
```

From there you can run the native client with something like:

```bash
cargo run -p unavi-native --features bevy/dynamic_linking
```

Or run the web client using `cargo-leptos`:

```bash
cargo leptos watch
```
