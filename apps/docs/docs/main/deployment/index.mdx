title: Deployment
---

We encourage anyone capable to deploy their own infrastructure for The Wired, whether for their own personal use, or to share with others - it is an important part of the project's mission to create a truly open platform.

## Architecture

There are two main components to The Wired, the client and the host. **Each app can be deployed independently** - you can run a host server without running a client, or vice versa. Additionally, the client can be run entirely locally on your computer, without needing to deploy it to a server.

## Getting started

Check out the following guides to get started:

import DocCardList from "@theme/DocCardList";

<DocCardList />
