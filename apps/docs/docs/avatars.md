You can upload and use custom VRM avatars within UNAVI.

## 🤔 What is VRM?

[VRM](https://vrm.dev/) is a free and open file format for 3D avatars, supported by many applications. You can create a VRM avatar using the [VRoid Editor](https://vroid.com/editor/en), or export to the `.vrm` file format from blender using [this blender plugin](https://github.com/saturday06/VRM_Addon_for_Blender).

UNAVI supports both the VRM 0.0 and 1.0 standards.

## 🚀 Performance Ranks

UNAVI categorizes avatars into performance ranks based on their optimization levels. This is not a perfect system, but it should give you a rough idea of how well an avatar will perform in UNAVI.

It's important to keep in mind that players may automatically block low-performing avatars, so it's a good idea to optimize your avatar as much as possible.
