# The UNAVI Vision

This document outlines the philosophical foundation, aesthetic principles, and
strategic direction of **UNAVI** and **The Wired**.

## What is UNAVI?

**UNAVI** is an open-source spatial browser — a gateway to a new,
three-dimensional [hypermedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypermedia).

Built primarily in [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/) using the
[Bevy](https://bevy.org/) engine, UNAVI serves as a reference implementation
of **The Wired protocol** — a framework for decentralized, interoperable
**spaces**.

A **space** is a 3D hyperdocument: a composable unit of hyperspace that can be
viewed, linked, and hosted by anyone. Spaces can contain objects, portals, and
behaviors, all expressed through open formats and scripting APIs.

UNAVI is not a walled garden. It is a foundation for an open, composable
ecosystem — where every space, identity, and creation connects through shared
standards.

## What is The Wired?

**The Wired** is the spatial hypermedia layer of the Internet — an open
protocol for representing and linking shared 3D information environments. It
defines how agents, spaces, and data interoperate across servers and clients
without central control.

But more than a specification, The Wired is a **philosophy**: that information
technology should reflect the natural order of human experience.

Current digital systems abstract information away from the human — flattening
it into screens and feeds. But humans cannot be separated from space and remain
whole. Like [feng shui](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feng_shui) teaches, form
and life are inseparable: meaning arises from the environments we inhabit.

The Wired reimagines information as **spatial** — something we move through,
inhabit, and shape with others. It restores form to the formless, reuniting
human and world.

### Creation and Autopoiesis

At the heart of The Wired is a computation layer powered by
[WebAssembly](https://webassembly.org/). The goal is a kind of
[autopoiesis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autopoiesis) — systems capable of
maintaining and regenerating their own structure. Much of UNAVI itself is built
within this WebAssembly layer.

Space in The Wired is seamless: transitions occur naturally through portals,
preserving continuity and presence. Each space is a sovereign hyperdocument,
addressed by decentralized identifiers, stored on personal servers, and linked
through hypermedia controls.

Agents traverse these spaces, carrying objects and behaviors between them.
Object logic is defined at the object level — independent of any single space —
allowing behavior to persist across contexts.

Through this model, The Wired forms an **ecology of computation**: agents and
spaces co-create experiences in a network of dynamic feedback. Every addition,
modification, or interaction propagates through the system, contributing to its
emergent form.

## The Vision

UNAVI exists to **manifest The Wired** — to give visible, inhabitable form to
the hidden network that already connects us.

For decades, the web has been a network of text and images: flat, abstract, and
detached from our natural sense of being in space. Yet humans evolved as
[spatial beings](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spatial_cognition) — our
cognition, emotion, and social instincts are grounded in presence, proximity,
and embodiment.

UNAVI’s vision is to restore this dimension to digital life: to create the
conditions for **real presence** in information space. This is not about
simulation or escapism — it is about *integration*.

The Wired continues the Internet into a more expressive, human form — one that
recognizes that **information itself must live in space**, alongside us.

Our goal is to open the floodgates of this new medium — to invite exploration,
discovery, and new cultural forms that can only exist once space itself becomes
the grammar of information.

### The Uniform Substrate

The Wired treats 3D space as a **universal grammar for information** — the same
way that HTML once unified documents, or URIs unified addressing. Each space
is a node in hyperspace, and each portal a hyperlink. The spatial medium is
therefore not a simulation layer, but the structural language through which all
digital phenomena can become visible, navigable, and alive.

## Principles

The Wired, expressed through UNAVI, should be:

- **Open** — Built on transparent, community-owned standards anyone can extend.
- **Interoperable** — Spaces, identities, and assets move freely across hosts
  and clients.
- **User-sovereign** — Users own their identities and data, and may host or
  delegate storage as they choose.
- **Generative** — Environments are alive, adaptive, and capable of internal
  growth.
- **Human-centered** — Designed to enhance presence, understanding, and
  communion between human and world.

## Philosophical Roots

UNAVI’s conceptual lineage draws from traditions exploring **technology,
space, and the fate of the individual**.

- **[Cybernetics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cybernetics)** — the study of
  feedback and self-regulating systems.
- **[Phenomenology](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phenomenology_(philosophy)>)**
  — particularly the work of
  [Martin Heidegger](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martin_Heidegger), whose
  notion of *Being-in-the-world* grounds existence in spatial relation. UNAVI
  takes this seriously: virtual space is not decoration but an existential
  medium.
- **[Christian humanism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christian_humanism)** —
  emphasizes the inherent dignity, worth, and potential of the individual as a
  bearer of the divine image. This aligns with UNAVI’s vision: reclaiming the
  individual against the flattening tendencies of the modern technosphere.
- **[Serial Experiments Lain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serial_Experiments_Lain)**
  — a prophetic artistic vision of The Wired as a psychic network and mirror of
  consciousness. UNAVI treats Lain not as fiction but as myth: an intuition of
  what the Internet could become (and has become) when interior life and
  technology converge.
- **[Nick Land](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nick_Land)** and accelerationist
  philosophy — recognizing that technological systems possess autonomous
  tendencies of self-organization and escape. UNAVI accepts this as fact but
  redirects our efforts toward the renewal of human form within the storm,
  rather than accepting its dissolution.
- **[Hypermedia Systems](https://hypermedia.systems/)** — A modern exploration
  of the Web as a hypermedia system, not an app platform. Advocates for a
  return to the original Web architecture. UNAVI applies this philosophy to 3D.

## The Wired Manifesto

> The true form of the Internet already exists.\
> We need only to let it express itself.

UNAVI is the first gesture toward that expression. The Wired is not an escape
from reality — it is reality, revealed in its authentic form.
